# **Please also read our [**`Gameplay Guidelines`**](/guidelines)**

> **The goal of these rules is to ensure everybody on this server is able to have a great experience.**
>
> Obviously, the best judgement will be used when enforcing these rules. If you need to report something, contact _A13X.

1. No Cheating (Hacking/X-Ray)

    1. Do not use clients, mods, or packs that give you an unfair advantage.
    2. Absolutely no lag machines or exploits in an attempt to crash or worsen the server's performance.
    3. Please report if you suspect that somebody is hacking.

2. Keep the server family-friendly

    1. Keep the chat family-friendly.
    2. No offensive remarks.
    3. Don't build anything inappropriate.
    4. Don't name items or mobs with inappropriate names.

3. Respect others (No Stealing, Only Friendly Griefing)
    
    1. Do not continually target or bully somebody with the intent of upsetting them.
    2. Don't take (steal) items or blocks of value from other players without their permission. This includes chests set up for things like public shops.
    3. Although **Greifing and Killing are not explicitly disallowed**, you must respect the time and effort that people have put into their work. Don't go around the world placing random blocks or destroying landscapes (that others will inevitably have to clean up if they want to build on).
    4. If you plan to prank somebody, make sure it's not too extreme. Try to prank only people that are on friendly terms with you, and make sure your pranks don't disrupt anybody who doesn't want to get involved.
    
4. [Contact us](/contact) if you need or want to suggest **anything**!
