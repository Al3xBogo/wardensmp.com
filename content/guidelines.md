# **Please also read our [**`Rules`**](/rules)**

> **The goal of these guidelines is to be a list of good practices on the server.**
>
> Although these are not enforced, I highly suggest reading through these to help make the WardenSMP experience as great as it can be!

1. Don't Kill Pets or Destroy People's Builds

    1. Unless you want the person to take revenge, of course! Don't kill pets or destroy people's work if you don't want to expect consequences from them!

2. Take your time

    1. There is no reason to rush. Please don't be the person who obtains maxed netherite gear within the first week! Bring the *Long-Term* into "Long-Term, Free-To-Play Survival"!
    2. Take your time and enjoy Minecraft for the sandbox game that it is! Whether it's learning some redstone or starting a new building project, there is plenty to do before (and after) beating the Ender Dragon!
    
3. Build your base near the spawn (or wherever everyone else is residing!)
    
    1. Although it's tempting to explore and set up an isolated base far into the wild Minecraft world, consider the fact that you're playing on a *Survival Multiplayer Server*. Why isolate yourself from the rest of the player base?
    2. Work together toward a common goal with the other members of the server. Whether it's building a town or defeating a boss, make it a *multiplayer* effort!
    
4. Don't spam the chat

    1. Nobody wants their screen to be filled up with garbage. Try to keep the chat relevant to the gameplay of the server. 
    2. Consider using the "/msg", "/r", or "/mail" commands for private messages on the server.

5. Leave stuff for others (don't pillage everything!)

    1. If you come across a rare structure or biome (village, bastion, mangrove forest, etc.), try to leave items for others. This allows slower-paced players to also get a chance to progress without having to venture out for thousands of blocks to find the same thing elsewhere.
    2. Of course, if there's only one of something there, i.e., an armor trim, consider selling copies of it! This gives others a chance to buy it, and it gives you a chance to capitalize on your findings.

6. Follow basic Minecraft server etiquette
    
    1. Don't leave trees floating
    2. FILL IN creeper holes (from explosions)
    3. When mining dirt or sand, travel a bit of a distance from where players are building/living.
    4. Use common sense.
